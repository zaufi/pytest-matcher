2.0.1_ -- 2024-03-15
====================

Added
-----

- Quick check for the :file:`ChangeLog.rst`.

Fixed
-----

- Release GitHub workflow has been fixed to use modern versions of involved actions.
- Do not override the path suffix-like part (separated by a dot) with a pattern
  filename extension.


2.0.0_ -- 2024-03-11
====================

Added
-----
- Introduce :option:`pm-pattern-file-fmt` configuration parameter to give full
  control over the path to pattern files.
- A test can be marked with :py:func:`@pytest.mark.expect_suffix <expect_suffix>`
  to have an arbitrary suffix in the pattern filenames.
  The :option:`pm-pattern-file-fmt` format string should have the ``{suffix}`` placeholder
  to make it work. See :issue:`22`.
- `Documentation`_.
- Introduce :option:`pm-mismatch-style`.
- Show newlines in the ``full`` mismatch mode.

Fixed
-----

- **BREAKING CHANGE** The expectation files path has never used the
  ``<test-module-name>`` component despite the :file:`README.rst` claimed.
  Existed projects could set :option:`pm-pattern-file-fmt` to
  ``{class}/{fn}{callspec}`` to preserve backward compatibility.

Removed
-------

- **BREAKING CHANGE** The :option:`!pm-pattern-file-use-system-name` configuration
  parameter has been removed. Having ``{suffix}`` in the :option:`pm-pattern-file-fmt`
  one can have a system name suffix whenever he needs it.


1.6.0_ -- 2024-02-29
====================

Added
-----

- :option:`--pm-reveal-unused-files` option to reveal unused pattern files.
- run test with :command:`pytest` 7.x and 8.x.


1.5.1_ -- 2024-01-15
====================

Fixed
-----

- Regression with Python less than 3.11.

1.5.0_ -- 2024-01-11
====================

Added
-----

- Make it possible to use :py:data:`expected_xxx <expected_out>` with parameterized tests. See :issue:`4`.


1.4.0_ -- 2021-12-10
====================

Added
-----

- Allow ``assert expected_out.match(blah_blah) is True``.

Changed
-------

- Migrate to :file:`setup.py`-less build (using :pep:`517` and :pep:`660`).


1.3.3_ -- 2019-06-27
====================

Fixed
-----

- Fix backward compatibility with Python less than 3.6.


1.3.2_ -- 2019-06-26
====================

Fixed
-----

- When a caller uses ``re.MULTILINE``, the plugin does not use ``splitlines``.


1.3.1_ -- 2019-04-04
====================

Added
-----

- Show actual and expected output on failed :py:func:`expected_out.match()`.

Changed
-------

- Update code for the modern ``pytest`` (4.4.0) and ``PyYAML`` (5.1).


1.2.1_ -- 2018-03-30
====================

Fixed
-----

- Update meta-data of the project for PyPi.


1.2.0_ -- 2018-03-30
====================

Added
-----

- Add an INI-file option :option:`!pm-pattern-file-use-system-name` to control if the system
  name suffix is expected to be in a pattern filename. For example, this allows patterns with
  different CR/LF conventions to be created.
- Add :py:data:`expected_yaml` fixture to match YAML files.
- Introduce unit tests.


1.1.0_ -- 2018-03-28
====================

Added
-----

- Use ``pytest.skip()`` if no pattern file has been found or it contains an invalid
  regular expression;
- Added doc-strings to the fixtures, so :command:`pytest --fixtures` would not complain.

Changed
-------

- Ensure full pattern match for :py:func:`expected_xxx.match <expected_out.match>` named fixtures.


1.0.0_ -- 2017-08-25
====================

Added
-----

- Add a pretty printer for failed assertions with the :py:data:`expected_out` fixture and equal
  comparison operator.
